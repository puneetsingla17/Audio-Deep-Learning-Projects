# Audio-Deep-Learning-Projects
In this repository I implemented various projects on Audio 

Audio Multi Label Classification:- https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging-2019/data

Audio Emotion Detection :- https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio
  > CNN-2D :-First Attempt
  
  > CNN-1D+LSTM Model :- Second Attempt
  
  > CNN-1D +LSTM Model :- Third Attempt  (6 fold CV) Followed by thresholding, Since Data was limited                

Next Idea that can be explored:- combining features of CNN2d and CNN 1d+LSTM and use stacking model on top of them
